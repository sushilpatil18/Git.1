    <p class="odd">From the First Great Ninja War to the Last,
        Shinobi have WOUNDED AND COME TO HATE EACH OTHER
        for the benefit of their OWN Nation and Village.
        That HATRED led to A DESIRE FOR POWER,
        and that DESIRE FOR POWER CREATED SOMEONE LIKE ME.</p>
    <p class="even">I too, was once FULL OF HATRED AND POWER!!!
        I WAS A JINCHUURIKI!!!
        I HATED THIS WORLD and ALL THE PEOPLE IN IT!!!
        I constantly thought of NOTHING BUT DESTROYING IT.
        I WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT AKATSUKI IS NOW!!!</p>
